# EVMGOD

Recently, I am learning the implementation details of [evm](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/), mainly looking at the implementation of [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm). So here are some demos for debugging revm to help me understand, also some solidity smart contracts.
